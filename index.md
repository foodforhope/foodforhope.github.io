India is being ravaged by the tsunami of Covid-19 cases. In this difficult time, it's always the most vulnerable sections of our society who suffer. To help them we are starting a service to provide emergency food to these people. We need your donations to help procure food supplies which we distribute daily across hospitals in bangalore.
